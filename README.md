###Why Right Click?
If you experience the bug, your touch screen will ONLY right click. Because of this, it makes sense to make the trigger right click, so you can just touch the icon to fix it. 
 
#Download
###[Download at the releases secton](https://github.com/gh123man/Surface-Touch-Fixer/releases)
 
 
##How does it work?
Packaged within the app is [DevManView.exe](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/device_manager_view.html) which is an freeware device manager that supports command line input. 
###Why DevManView?
- Becuase its license permits it to be packaged with or within another app.

#Start with windows
 While starting with Windows is not supported in the app, you can add it to startup folder as a shortcut.
